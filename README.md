# News-Aggregator
Hello friend
This project aggregates news from two different APIs.
The project made whit django and rest framework.
To get started, you need to start django project and use the following urls on your local host:
for list of all news:
      http://localhost:8000/news/
and for search in news:
      http://localhost:8000/news/search?query=bitcoin
      
Thank you
